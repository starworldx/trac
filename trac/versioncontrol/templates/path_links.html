{# Displays a sequence of path components.

  Each component is a link to the corresponding location in the browser.

  We expect the following variables to be available in the calling
  context:

   * `path_links`, a list of dicts each having the following keys:
     * `name`, the path component name
     * `href`, a link pointing to this path
   * `stickyrev`, the optional revision information to show
   * `reponame`, the optional repository name
#}
# if path_links:
## the realm:
<a class="pathentry first" href="${path_links[0].href}"
   title="${_('Go to repository index') if reponame else
            _("Go to repository root")}">${path_links[0].name}</a>
{# the/path/.../...

  Note: in the `for` loop below, we take great care of not introducing
        any space characters, so that one can easily copy the path to
        the clipboard.
