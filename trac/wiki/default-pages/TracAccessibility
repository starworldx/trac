= Accessibility Support in Trac

Not every user has a graphic environment with a mouse or other pointing device. Some users rely on a keyboard, alternative keyboard or voice input to navigate links and activate form controls. In a Trac session, users can use a device other than a pointing device by enabling keyboard shortcuts through the [/prefs/userinterface Keyboard Shortcuts] preferences panel.

== Global Access Keys

The global access keys differ by browser and the following work for several browsers:
 - on Linux, press any of the keys listed below in combination with the `<Alt>` key
 - on a Mac, use `<Ctrl>` + `<Opt>` + `<Key>`
 - on Windows, use `<Shift> + <Alt> + <Key>`. This works for the most common browsers, such as Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Internet Explorer

See [wikipedia:Access_key#Access_in_different_browsers access in different browsers] for more details.

== TracBrowser Navigation

The browser can be navigated using the keys listed below. The key modifiers listed above are not used for navigating the browser.

* `j` and `k` - select the next or previous entry, starting with the first
* `o` ('''o'''pen) - toggle between expanded and collapsed state of the selected  directory or visit the selected file
* `v` ('''v'''iew, '''v'''isit) and `<Enter>` - same as above
* `r` - '''r'''eload an already expanded directory
* `a` - directly visit a file in '''a'''nnotate (blame) mode
* `L` - view the '''L'''og for the selected entry

If no row has been selected using `j` or `k`, the keys will operate on the entry under the mouse.
