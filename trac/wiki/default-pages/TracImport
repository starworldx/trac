= Importing ticket data

[[PageOutline(2-5,Contents,pullout)]]

To migrate issue tickets from other issue-tracking systems into Trac or perform housekeeping actions on tickets or simply synchronize different databases, there are some tools, plugins and scripts available.

== !TicketImportPlugin

[https://trac-hacks.org/wiki/TicketImportPlugin TicketImportPlugin]: a plugin that lets you import or update into Trac a series of tickets from a '''CSV file''' or (if the [https://pypi.python.org/pypi/xlrd xlrd library] is installed) from an '''Excel spreadsheet'''.

== !ExportImportXlsPlugin

[https://trac-hacks.org/wiki/ExportImportXlsPlugin ExportImportXlsPlugin]: a plugin that adds an admin panel for exporting and importing tickets via '''XLS file'''. Requires the python packages xlwt/rxld.

== Jira

[https://trac-hacks.org/wiki/JiraToTracIntegration JiraToTracIntegration]: a plugin that provides tools to import Atlassian Jira backup files into Trac. The plugin consists of a Python 3.1 commandline tool that:
 - Parses the Jira backup XML file.
 - Sends the imported Jira data and attachments to Trac using the [https://trac-hacks.org/wiki/XmlRpcPlugin XmlRpcPlugin].
 - Generates a htpasswd file containing the imported Jira users and their SHA-512 base64 encoded passwords.

== Mantis

[https://trac-hacks.org/wiki/MantisImportScript MantisImportScript]: a script to import the following type of data from Mantis into Trac:
 * bugs
 * bug comments
 * bug activity (field changes)
 * attachments (as long as the files live in the mantis database, not on the filesystem).

== !PlanetForge

[https://trac-hacks.org/wiki/PlanetForgeImportExportPlugin PlanetForgeImportExportPlugin]: this plugin exports Trac data (wiki, tickets, compoments, permissions, repositories, etc.) using the open format designed by the [https://gforge.inria.fr/projects/coclico/ COCLICO] project. It extends the webadmin panel and the 'trac admin ...' command. Has no 'import' feature.

== Scarab

[https://trac-hacks.org/wiki/ScarabToTracScript ScarabToTracScript]: a script that migrates Scarab issues to Trac tickets. Requires [https://trac-hacks.org/wiki/XmlRpcPlugin XmlRpcPlugin].

== Other

Since Trac uses a SQL database to store the data, you can also custom-import from other systems by examining the database tables. Just go into [https://www.sqlite.org/sqlite.html sqlite] command line to look at the tables and import them from your application.
